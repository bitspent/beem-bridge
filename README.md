# BEEM
Giving a boost to Ether and ERC20 Tokens

## Abstract
Ethereum the Robust Smart Contract Decentralized Computing Blockchain Network has enabled the development of unlimited Utility Tokens. Thus its transaction speed is slow and not handy for fast purpose payments businesses such as gaming platforms.
We present the BEEM Bridge, a sidechain running on the STEEM Blockchain to solve this issue benefitting from the security and processing speed of STEEM’s Blockchain on a near time transfer speed of 3 seconds for a transaction confirmation.

## How it works
Acting as a bridge, BEEM has two endpoints - addresses on Both Ethereum and STEEM Blockchains:
*	BEEM Ethereum Address: Deposit and Withdrawal Point.
*	BEEM STEEM Account: Sidechain Operations and Transfers

### To benefit from the sidechain, a user should:
1.	Link his STEEM Account to his Ethereum Wallet.
2.	Deposit his required Ether or ERC20 Token on BEEM Ethereum Address.
3.	Once deposited he can transact at near time speed on the Sidechain with the existing users.
4.	Whenever done operating on the sidechain, he can withdraw his Tokens to his Ethereum Wallet.

#### Ethereum to Steem Link
Operating on the sidechain requires to have a STEEM account. Before depositing the user should link his STEEM account. The link is a simply an Ethereum transaction to BEEM Ethereum’s address with raw data content his STEEM Account.

#### Sidechain Deposit
After linking the STEEM account, the user will be able to deposit Ether or ERC20 Tokens to the sidechain. The deposit in simply an Ethereum transaction to BEEM Ethereum’s address in case of an Ether deposit, or an ERC20 Token transfer to BEEM Ethereum’s address.

#### Sidechain Operations
On each deposit operation, user’s sidechain balance is reflected. On the sidechain the user will be able to transfer Ether or ERC20 token to other linked accounts, or check his sidechain balance or Withdraw to his Ethereum’s wallet.
